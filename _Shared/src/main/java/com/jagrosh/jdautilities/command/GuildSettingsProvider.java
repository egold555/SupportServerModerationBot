/**
 * A basic frame that is optionally implementable by objects returned from
 * {@link GuildSettingsManager#getSettings(net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Guild)
 * GuildSettingsManager#getSettings(Guild)}.
 *
 * <p>This interface allows the specification of any of the following functions:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Guild Specific Prefixes (via {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.command.GuildSettingsProvider#getPrefixes()})</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that all of these functions are <b>OPTIONAL</b> to implement, and instructions
 * are available in method documentation on how to implement properly.
 * <br>Additionally, as stated before, the interface itself does not need to be
 * implemented for an object to be returned handled by a GuildSettingsManager.

 *         methods.
 *         <br>If in the future it is decided to add a method
 *         to this interface, the method will have a default
