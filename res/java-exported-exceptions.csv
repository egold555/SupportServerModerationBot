java.util.ConcurrentModificationException,"This exception may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.  For example, it is not generally permissible for one thread to modify a Collection while another thread is iterating over it.  In general, the results of the iteration are undefined under these circumstances.  Some Iterator implementations (including those of all the general purpose collection implementations provided by the JRE) may choose to throw this exception if this behavior is detected.  Iterators that do this are known as fail-fast iterators, as they fail quickly and cleanly, rather that risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.  Note that this exception does not always indicate that an object has been concurrently modified by a different thread.  If a single thread issues a sequence of method invocations that violates the contract of an object, the object may throw this exception.  For example, if a thread modifies a collection directly while it is iterating over the collection with a fail-fast iterator, the iterator will throw this exception. Note that fail-fast behavior cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast operations throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness: ConcurrentModificationException should be used only to detect bugs.",,,

javax.security.sasl.AuthenticationException,"This exception is thrown by a SASL mechanism implementation to indicate that the SASL exchange has failed due to reasons related to authentication, such as an invalid identity, passphrase, or key.  Note that the lack of an AuthenticationException does not mean that the failure was not due to an authentication error.

However, the exception might simply mean that the data was invalid in the context it was used, or that the object to which the data was given was unable to parse or use it. For example, a file reader might not be able to parse a Type 2 MIDI file, even though that format is defined in the MIDI specification.",,,
javax.sound.midi.MidiUnavailableException,"A MidiUnavailableException is thrown when a requested MIDI component cannot be opened or created because it is unavailable.  This often occurs when a device is in use by another application.  More generally, it can occur when there is a finite number of a certain kind of resource that can be used for some purpose, and all of them are already in use (perhaps all by this application).  For an example of the latter case, see the setReceiver method of Transmitter.",,,

javax.sql.rowset.spi.SyncProviderException,"Indicates an error with the SyncProvider mechanism. This exception is created by a SyncProvider abstract class extension if it encounters violations in reading from or writing to the originating data source.  If it is implemented to do so, the SyncProvider object may also create a SyncResolver object and either initialize the SyncProviderException object with it at construction time or set it with the SyncProvider object at a later time.  The method acceptChanges will throw this exception after the writer has finished checking for conflicts and has found one or more conflicts. An application may catch a SyncProviderException object and call its getSyncResolver method to get its SyncResolver object. See the code fragment in the interface comment for SyncResolver for an example. This SyncResolver object will mirror the RowSet object that generated the exception, except that it will contain only the values from the data source that are in conflict.  All other values in the SyncResolver object will be null.  The SyncResolver object may be used to examine and resolve each conflict in a row and then go to the next row with a conflict to repeat the procedure.  A SyncProviderException object may or may not contain a description of the condition causing the exception.  The inherited method getMessage may be called to retrieve the description if there is one.",,,
